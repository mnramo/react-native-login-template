## Overview

Project is **not using any state management containers like Redux, Flux or MobX**, so feel free to implement your favorite one.

Project uses [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) for navigation. **There are only 2 screens** so there is not much to navigate between ;)

**Feel free to implement your favorite navigation module.**

For animations I used [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) module.


I created simple splash screen using [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) module, **if you want to make your own splash screen please take a look at this module.** Everything you need is described there.

## Installation
1. Download or copy this repository.
2. Using terminal, go to project folder and run this command:

3. Run it on iOS simulator using command:

4. **That's all. Enjoy amazing login screen for your amazing application :)**

## Code Style

I am using eslint.

Here is my **.eslintrc.js** config file:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    "extends": "airbnb",
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "rules": {
       "react/jsx-filename-extension": ["error", { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
    }
};
```
